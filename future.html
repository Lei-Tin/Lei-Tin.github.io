            <h2>I would first finish my undergraduate study</h2>

            <h3>Get some internship going at the same time</h3>

            <h4>And start preparing myself for graduate studies</h4>

            <h5>I would also want to be employed in the top tech companies in the world somewhere around that</h5>

            <h6>If I really could, maybe I could start my own tech company?</h6>

            <p>No matter where I end up being for my undergraduate degree, I would still give my best shot in trying to get the most out of it</p>
