# The feeling of emptiness

Well, after the semester's been through, I did find something to do throughout the summer, but it wasn't ideal. 

I was constrained to a lot of things, internet, devices, time, ...

It was if like, I am just not getting anything throughout these days. The time in my world just stopped ticking all of a sudden. 

What I have used to enjoy in the past doesn't quite bring the same feeling anymore. Seeing people and things I like just disappearing from the internet for years makes me disheartened, but yet I don't feel a whole lot. 

# Negatives aside

I actually tried to learn React these days, maybe I will be able to publish a well designed website sometime soon? I'm not quite sure, and we'll have to see if I can work up towards my goals. It's just that, things recently, are not looking very interesting. 

# That's about it!

See you in the next one as always! Also, sorry for not updating for quite a long time :3

Will come back and update more often soon!
