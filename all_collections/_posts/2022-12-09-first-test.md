# How's it going?

Well, it's been roughly a week from the last time that I have updated this blog. However, that is actually because I was pretty busy trying to study for my term tests. 

Just today (December 8 actually), I just completed one of my Term Tests. It went pretty well, until I left the exam venue and realized that some of the answers I wrote may not be the right answer ðŸ˜”.

# Submission for a project

Also! I managed to turn in two of my important projects for this semester! They seemed to do pretty well, but I'm not sure with the grades at the current moment. 

However, the stress for my other courses is still building up, and it is slightly making me feel at unease. That's alright though, as I am learning a lot after persevering through these hardships. 

# That's it for today!

See you guys in the next post!
