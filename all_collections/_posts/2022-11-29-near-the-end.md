# Can't believe it's already almost near the end of the semester

Well, it is almost near December, which marks the end of the Fall Semester. 

I've had a few plans during the short break in between, but things just felt tough all around these days, as exams are approaching. However, feeling down and stressed will not help towards my problems, they will just allow problems to pile up until I eventually breakdown. 

# Skipping away from academic stress

We'll see how my internship applications for the Summer lands, but so far, I have yet to receive any feedbacks from any of my applications. If worst comes to the worst, I'll probably spend my Summer Vacation doing online courses that could build onto my resume. 

# That's it!

Anyways, that's it for today's blog :3

Sorry for all the negativity, but, that's how life works sometimes.
