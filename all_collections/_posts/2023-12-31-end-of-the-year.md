# Well, seems like I have forgottten about the existence of this blog? 

Not necessarily have forgotten about it, just cared less to upload anything about me up here frequently. 

The negatives aside, hope you guys are having a wonderful time as well! It was about roughly a year ago that I made this blog, and fortunately, it is still up and running now! Although, I guess, I did not make too much changes to this blog, but I still think it suffices the purpose of me just posting random stuff in here. 

# I actually landed an internship!

Well, if you know me well enough, you'd know that I applied to a lot of openings last year, but most of them didn't work. However, I actually landed an ML internship position this summer, which is great! Really looking forward to be learning a lot from it in a while! 

# Well then, see you next time! 

This time, I actually cared to also grab an ASCII art for the new year to end it off :3
