# Hey!

Just updating this blog again, the first few weeks will definitely receive a lot of updates :3

Right now, it's 3:12 in the morning, but I just finished doing some academic works. Not really sure what to think about right now, but I feel a little bit tired but not really at the same time. 

I just felt a little bit tired, as doing the group project with a group more than 4 people that you really know well does impact your efficiency and your ability to create better solutions. 

Anyways, I will try to sleep now, as I probably still have to go to a library tommorow to review for an upcoming test. See you guys in the next post!
