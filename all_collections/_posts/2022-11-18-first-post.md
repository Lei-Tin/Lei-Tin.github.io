# First blog post!

Hi everyone that's seeing this post! I'm Ray, and thank you for visiting this website! 

# Self introduction

At the time of this writing, I am currently a second year student in the University of Toronto, St. George's campus. Currently studying `Computer Science Specialist` and maybe `Math Minor` and `Statistics Minor`. But I might just drop out of the other two and just graduate with `Computer Science Specialist` ðŸ˜¦. 

In my spare time, I like to draw things (On a Twitter account that I don't feel like sharing at the moment), play video games, play with friends, and watch anime! ðŸ’–

Also, writing some stupid code that probably other people have already written is also what I like to do! Although it may seem useless at times, but it really does make me feel excited when I am trying to solve a problem on my own (But not when the problem is too hard)! 

That's a pretty brief introduction for me, but that will do! ðŸ¦Š

# My blog!

This is a website that runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free website hosting service provided by GitHub! 

From today onwards, November 18, 2022, I will try to update this blog as much as possible, to include any fun information that I feel like sharing to the world! In other words, this will be my sancturary from the rest of the world when I don't feel like it!
