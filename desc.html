            <p>I am currently a secondary school student studying in an <abbr title="The program is IB">international school</abbr> located at Xiamen, China. </p>
            <p>My full name is actually Hung, Shou-Yi (Ray), but I am used to being called Ray</p>
            <p>I am currently 16 years old and I'm from Taiwan</p>
            <p>I like to edit videos, play games, do anything related to computers in general</p>
            <p>This is exactly why I found the CS50 course specifically interesting, where I learn more through problem sets and online lectures</p>
            <p>instead of books <mark>(They're the worst)</mark></p>

            <p>I would really like to study in the United States, specifically Harvard after my secondary school</p>
            <p>I really hope that I could get in!</p>
            <p>That's about it for my personal description :3</p>
